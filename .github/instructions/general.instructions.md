When you want to create new documentation files, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the appropriate directory, that is docs/.
2. Use the existing documentation files as a reference for structure and formatting.
3. Include relevant information, code snippets, and examples to illustrate the topic.
4. Follow the established naming conventions and directory structure.
5. Update any necessary configuration files (e.g., `mkdocs.yml`, `README.md`) to include the new documentation.
6. Do not implement new documentation files when is not explictly asked.
7. Do not add inline comments such as "   # something" when you write code.
