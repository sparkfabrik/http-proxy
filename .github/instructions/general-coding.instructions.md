# General Coding Guidelines

## Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use meaningful and descriptive names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
- Write self-documenting code
- When you think it is needed, for a new feature or significant change, consider adding the documentation to the #README.md file or in the #docs/ directory.
- When we add new env variables, make sure they are documented in the `README.md` and added to the #example/compose.yml file.
